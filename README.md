Github for material masks for skyrim textures, feel free to submit a pr with any masks you want to contribute.

The paths work by following the texture path, with a final folder for the texture itself where the masks will go in.

Please make it clear what each thing the masks are for (name it something like mask_nails, mask_wood)

Example: if you wanted to upload a mask for steel materials on the texture daedricarmor.dds, the final path (including the mask) would be:

vanilla/textures/armor/daedric/daedricarmor/mask_steel.png

Use the vanilla folder for vanilla (and cc) content

Use the mod folder for modded content, please begin your texture path with the mod name (you may shorten it, but if you do, include the mod author name as well).

Please also include a text file with a link to the mod in your top folder, and include a link in your PR.

example: if you are uploading masks for the mod "Stewards of Skyrim - New Clothing for Stewards (hdtSMP - Vanilla Body - CBBE - HIMBO)",
you may either name the top folder "Stewards of Skyrim - New Clothing for Stewards (hdtSMP - Vanilla Body - CBBE - HIMBO)" or you can name it "Stewards of Skyrim - Kreiste"

= FOR ANY MODDED CONTENT MASKS, PLEASE ONLY UPLOAD CONTENT WITH FULLY OPEN PERMISSIONS OR WITH EXPLICIT PERMISSION FROM THE MOD AUTHOR =
