github for material masks for skyrim textures has been made, feel free to submit a pr with any masks you want to contribute

the way the paths work right now is it follows the texture path, with a final folder for the texture itself where the masks will go in.

please make it clear what each thing the masks are for (name it something like mask_nails, mask_wood)

example: if you wanted to upload a mask for steel materials on the texture daedricarmor.dds, the final path (including the mask) would be 

vanilla/textures/armor/daedric/daedricarmor/mask_steel.png

vanilla folder for vanilla (and cc) content
mod folder for modded content
